AI is obviously a hot topic in software development everywhere. Excitement about how ChatGPT can carry out previously challenging tasks so seamlessly, or concerns about AI taking over the jobs of many vulnerable people. But I remember reading from somewhere about how what we call AI now isn't really... "artificial intelligence."  

> They are showing human-level competence in low-level pattern recognition skills, but at the cognitive level they are merely imitating human intelligence, not engaging deeply and creatively.

So what does it mean that AI is creating racist art or blurting out commonly said racist comments about non-white people? [This article](https://decrypt.co/155929/ai-racist-experts-say-heres-why) on Decrypt shows how it is a dangerous trend that is not talked about enough. The racism that they are producing is a reflection of human discrimination. As someone studying to be part of the next new generation of software developers, it makes me think about the responsibility of the programmer. Even small things like boxes for users to enter names can contain biases about what we think are acceptable forms of names.

If there is a silver lining, it is that these challenges promote more diversity in the workplace! With different perspectives and backgrounds, people can see some inherent biases that others might not have. This empowers teamwork, cooperation, and raises up people of all backgrounds.
